# GitHub Milestones and Issues Creation Guide

This guide provides instructions for creating the GitHub milestones and issues based on the development milestones documentation.

## Overview

Based on the `development-milestones.md` file, you need to create:
- **7 Milestones** representing major development phases
- **27 Issues** with detailed acceptance criteria

## Quick Setup Using GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can use the provided script to create everything automatically:

```bash
# Run the automated creation script
chmod +x .github/scripts/create-github-milestones.sh
.github/scripts/create-github-milestones.sh
```

## Continue for All Milestones

Follow the same pattern for Milestones 3-7 using the detailed information in `development-milestones.md`.

## Labels to Create

Create these labels for better organization:
- `milestone-1` through `milestone-7` (one for each milestone)
- `enhancement` (for new features)
- `bug` (for bug fixes)
- `documentation` (for docs)
- `priority-high`, `priority-medium`, `priority-low` (for prioritization)

## Notes

- All acceptance criteria should be turned into GitHub checkboxes using `- [ ]`
- Update issue status as work progresses
- Reference the original `development-milestones.md` for complete details
- Consider adding time estimates to issues for better planning
