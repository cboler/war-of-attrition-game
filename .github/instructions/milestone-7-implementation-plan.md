## Issue Analysis & Remediation Plan

### ðŸ”´ **Issue #64: Opponent gains cards when winning** 
**Priority:** CRITICAL | **Type:** Game Logic Bug | **Complexity:** Medium

#### **Problem Analysis:**
- Game rules specify: Players start with 26 cards each, cards should be discarded when lost
- Current issue: Opponent somehow gains more than 26 cards
- **Root Cause:** Likely in `TurnResolutionService` or `GameStateService` card handling logic

#### **Investigation Areas:**
1. `TurnResolutionService.resolveNormalWin()` - Lines 47-51 and 130-135
2. `GameStateService.returnCardsToOpponentDeck()` - May be adding instead of proper management
3. Battle resolution logic - Lines 151-177 in turn resolution

#### **Remediation Steps:**
1. **Audit card flow logic:**
   - Review `returnCardsToOpponentDeck()` and `returnCardsToPlayerDeck()` methods
   - Verify cards are only returned to original owner's deck, not transferred
   
2. **Fix card management:**
   - Ensure winner keeps their own card only
   - Ensure loser's card goes to discard pile only
   - Add validation: no deck should exceed 26 cards
   
3. **Add safeguards:**
   ```typescript
   // Add to GameStateService
   private validateDeckCounts(): void {
     if (this.playerDeck().count > 26 || this.opponentDeck().count > 26) {
       throw new Error('Deck count exceeds maximum of 26 cards');
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests for deck count validation
   - Integration tests for complete turn flows
   - Manual testing with debug logging

### ðŸ”´ **Issue #63: HP and deck count only update after battle or declined challenge**
**Priority:** CRITICAL | **Type:** UI State Bug | **Complexity:** Low

#### **Problem Analysis:**
- Normal turn losses don't update HP/card counts in real-time
- UI state not synchronizing with game state changes
- **Root Cause:** Missing signal updates or reactive bindings in UI

#### **Investigation Areas:**
1. `Game` component reactive bindings - Lines 48-50 in game.ts
2. `GameStateService` signal updates - Lines 119-135
3. UI template bindings for health bars and card counts

#### **Remediation Steps:**
1. **Fix reactive bindings:**
   - Ensure `playerCardCount` and `opponentCardCount` signals properly track deck changes
   - Verify health bar components react to card count changes
   
2. **Update Game component:**
   ```typescript
   // In Game component constructor, add proper reactive subscriptions
   this.playerCardCount = computed(() => this.gameStateService.playerCardCount());
   this.opponentCardCount = computed(() => this.gameStateService.opponentCardCount());
   ```

3. **Verify signal propagation:**
   - Check that deck modifications trigger signal updates
   - Ensure UI components use reactive computed values

4. **Testing:**
   - Test normal turn outcomes update counts immediately
   - Verify health bar animations trigger correctly
   - Test across all game phases

### ðŸ”´ **Issue #61: Can cancel challenge after drawing card**
**Priority:** CRITICAL | **Type:** Game Logic Bug | **Complexity:** Low

#### **Problem Analysis:**
- Game rules: Once challenge card is drawn, player is committed to challenge
- Current: `cancelChallenge()` method allows backing out after seeing card
- **Root Cause:** UI provides cancel option after card reveal

#### **Investigation Areas:**
1. `GameControllerService.cancelChallenge()` - Lines 169-192
2. Challenge UI flow in game template
3. Challenge state management logic

#### **Remediation Steps:**
1. **Remove cancel option post-draw:**
   - Disable/remove `cancelChallenge()` method
   - Update UI to only show "Proceed" after challenge card drawn
   
2. **Update challenge flow:**
   ```typescript
   // Modify handleChallenge to commit immediately on accept
   handleChallenge(acceptChallenge: boolean): void {
     if (acceptChallenge) {
       // Draw card and immediately proceed - no cancel option
       const challengeCard = this.gameStateService.drawPlayerCard();
       this.proceedWithChallenge(challengeCard);
     } else {
       // Only decline option is before drawing
       this.declineChallenge();
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Update UI templates:**
   - Remove cancel button from challenge card display
   - Show clear commitment message
   - Update button text to reflect commitment

4. **Testing:**
   - Verify no cancel option after card drawn
   - Test challenge commitment works correctly
   - Ensure proper game flow

### ðŸŸ¡ **Issue #62: Bundle size warnings, optimization**
**Priority:** IMPORTANT | **Type:** Performance | **Complexity:** Medium

#### **Problem Analysis:**
- Bundle size: 849KB (349KB over 500KB budget)
- Main contributor: Angular Material components (likely importing entire modules)
- **Root Cause:** Non-optimized imports and lack of code splitting

#### **Investigation Areas:**
1. Angular Material imports in components
2. Bundle analysis with `ng build --stats-json`
3. Potential for lazy loading and code splitting

#### **Remediation Steps:**
1. **Optimize Material imports:**
   ```typescript
   // Instead of importing entire modules, import specific components
   // Before: import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';
   // After: Import only what's needed per component
   ```

2. **Implement lazy loading:**
   - Move settings page to lazy-loaded route
   - Consider lazy loading game demo features
   
3. **Bundle optimization:**
   - Enable tree-shaking for unused code
   - Optimize image assets and card graphics
   - Consider CDN for Material Icons

4. **Performance budget adjustment:**
   ```json
   // In angular.json, consider updating budgets
   "budgets": [
     {
       "type": "initial",
       "maximumWarning": "750kb",
       "maximumError": "1mb"
     }
   ]
   ```

5. **Testing:**
   - Measure bundle size reduction
   - Verify app functionality unchanged
   - Test loading performance

   protected battleRevealPhase = signal<'selection' | 'player-reveal' | 'opponent-reveal' | 'resolution'>('selection');
   ```

2. **Implement sequential reveals:**
   - Player's selected card reveals first
   - Brief pause for review
   - Opponent's selected card reveals
   - Show battle result with all cards
   - Non-selected cards reveal for losing side

3. **Add timing controls:**
   - Settings for animation speed
   - Appropriate delays between phases
   - Clear visual indicators

4. **Update battle UI:**
   - Better card positioning and layout
   - Clear indication of selected cards
   - Proper reveal animations

5. **Testing:**
   - Test battle sequence timing
   - Verify all cards reveal appropriately
   - Test with different animation speeds
