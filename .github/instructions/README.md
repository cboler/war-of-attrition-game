## 📚 How to Use This Documentation

### For New Developers
1. Start with `war-of-attrition-requirements.md` to understand the game
2. Review `current-development-status.md` for project overview
3. Check `development-milestones.md` for work breakdown
4. Reference `implementation-guidelines.md` when implementing

### For Project Management
- Use `development-milestones.md` to track progress
- Convert issues to GitHub Issues/Project boards
- Update status in `current-development-status.md` as work completes
- Milestone completion should be clearly marked

### For Development Work
- Always reference requirements document for authoritative specs
- Follow milestone order to ensure proper dependencies
- Use implementation guidelines for technical decisions
- Update documentation as the project evolves

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Set up development environment**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository>
   cd war-of-attrition-game
   npm install
   ```

2. **Review current state**:
   ```bash
   npm start  # Start development server
   npm run build  # Test production build
   ```

3. **Start development**:
   - Pick up where Milestone 1 left off
   - Focus on settings route implementation
   - Add theme persistence
   - Create responsive layout foundation

4. **Follow best practices**:
   - Use Angular signals for state management
   - Implement standalone components
   - Write tests alongside implementation
   - Maintain mobile-first responsive design

## 📝 Documentation Maintenance

- **Status updates**: Regularly update `current-development-status.md`
- **Milestone tracking**: Mark completed issues in `development-milestones.md`
- **Implementation notes**: Add learnings to `implementation-guidelines.md`
- **Requirements**: NEVER modify `war-of-attrition-requirements.md`

This documentation structure ensures clear development guidance while maintaining the integrity of the original requirements specification.
